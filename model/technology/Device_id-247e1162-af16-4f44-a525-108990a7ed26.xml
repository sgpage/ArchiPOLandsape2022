    documentation="RS232 connected Avery Berkel devices which underwent National Weights and Measures approval; they can be shared between two terminals; a terminal ‘claims’ the device for the duration of its use and this is shown by a ‘left’ and ‘right’ indicator on the scales themselves. All Post Office owned branches have these and many sub-postmasters have purchased scales to reduce transaction times"/>
