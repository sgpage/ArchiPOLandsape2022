Some of these boxes are organised but most are not and contain a variety of loose paperwork relating to branches (specifically Franchise branches), contracts and I also noticed a coupe of CD-ROMs that appear to have application interview records on them. In addition to this there are several boxes that contain applicant details/paperwork for Post Office branches. &#xA;Photo 2 – 6 large crates containing Subsidy Scheme application paperwork plus two large boxes (which again contain a variety of unorganised files)&#xA;Photo 3 – 25 boxes of Operation Manuals. There are 8 boxes of Main Operation Manuals (MM1 Cleared 01.10.12 code 3A_3832923_18), 13 boxes of Local Operation Manuals – Post Office cash (code 3A_3852015_5) and 4 boxes of Local Operation Manuals – Operator cash (23.07.12 3A_3854535_8). Each of the relevant manual type is the same in each box. In addition to this there is 1 box containing brochures called ‘Security Counts – a Guide to Security Procedures dated 2003.&#xA;Photo 4/5/6 – 8 eleven kg bags of confidential waste. I opened these up and found that they contained branch files &quot;&#xA;"/>
