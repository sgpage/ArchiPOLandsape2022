    documentation="At the end of each Trading Day, all transactions for the day are validated and any transactions failing validation will be moved to a Quarantine area.  Validation failures include the following scenarios:&#xD;&#xA;  Invalid Negative Value: Negative values are only allowed for reversal records or if the Delivery Agreement indicates that the transaction is an Out-payment transaction.&#xD;&#xA;  Unmatched Reversal: This is a reversal record where the corresponding original transaction is not present on the current Trading Day.  This may occur in certain counter recovery scenarios.&#xD;&#xA;  Missing Delivery Agreement: Delivery Agreement reference data controls the creation of AP Client Files.  If the data is missing for any client then the transactions cannot be delivered and will be quarantined.&#xD;&#xA;  Duplicate Transaction: Duplicate transactions are not expected and can only occur in the case of system bugs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Quarantined transactions can be viewed and processed using a Graphical User Interface available to the Fujitsu third-line support team.  Where transactions were quarantined due to missing or invalid reference data then the transactions can be moved back into the main processing stream once that reference data has been corrected.  These transactions will then be delivered to the AP Client.  In the case of an unmatched reversal, since the original transaction will almost certainly have been sent to the AP Client then a manual activity must be in place to inform the AP Client that the payment has been reversed.  The transaction will then be archived as manually processed"/>
