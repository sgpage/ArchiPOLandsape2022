    documentation="Automated Payments Out Pay. APOP is a Voucher Database introduced initially to implement the new style Postal Order.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The design allows the database to be customised using reference data&#xD;&#xA;The APOP database contains a table of predefined fields.&#xD;&#xA;APOP is configured using “Meta Data” to define which of the fields are to be used and allows the predefined fields to be given a meaningful name for the particular service. (e.g. the predefined field Alpha_1 may be called Product Desc for the Stock Ordering service).&#xD;&#xA;The Meta Data defines the Voucher States that are used to manage the lifecycle of a voucher record (e.g. Sold -> Encashed -> Archived)&#xD;&#xA;The Meta Data defines the allowable state changes to ensure the lifecycle steps are performed in the permitted order.&#xD;&#xA;Business Rules for user access, data input, data output, state changes and transaction types are all set using Meta Data as are error messages and exceptions.&#xD;&#xA;Each ‘voucher’ is given a unique ID for the particular APOP service.&#xD;&#xA;This Voucher ID is used to reference the voucher record.&#xD;&#xA;APOP is able to retain a history of updates made to a voucher record for audit."/>
