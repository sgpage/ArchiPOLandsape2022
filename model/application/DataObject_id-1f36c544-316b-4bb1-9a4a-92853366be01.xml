    documentation="Containts all the common trading reference data needed to drive a HNGA terminal. This is pushed to the counter by RDDS.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The application will always use a complete reference data package. It will use the branch specific reference data that goes with the latest common reference data package, even though more up to date branch specific data may be available.&#xD;&#xA;When the first business user logs on to the system each day , the business application will decide whether it has a valid reference data configuration, and if not valid, will inform the user, request the data and wait for the data to become available.&#xD;&#xA;If a new version of reference data becomes available during a logged on session, the application will wait until an appropriate opportunity such as between customer sessions to put the new version into use.&#xD;&#xA;The detailed format and interfaces between the reference data distribution system and the business application are described in HNG-X Reference Data Architecture (ARC/APP/ARC/0001).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Common reference data is normally delivered as deltas from the previous distributed version. However, the application may request a complete refresh of the common reference data package."/>
