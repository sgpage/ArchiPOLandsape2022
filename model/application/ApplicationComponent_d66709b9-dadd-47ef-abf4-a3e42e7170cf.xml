    documentation="Branch Lookup and Capacity Service. Local Collect Capacity system. Used to track how many local collect parcels are in a branch and provides an API to Royal Mail to allow its Click and Collect customers to find a branch that has capacity to delivery to.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Not part of the Horizon back end as such. Hosted in the Fujitsu DMZ.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Wildly inaccurate and so not much use. Has a &quot;stop&quot; button that a branch manager can use to stop parcels being delivered to the branch in case he has no more space to store them."/>
