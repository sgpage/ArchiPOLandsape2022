    documentation="The reference data subsystem encapsulates the capabilities to provide a data-centric view of the reference data used by the application, to retrieve reference data from a remote source, and to store and retrieve reference data from a local repository.&#xD;&#xA;A single Reference Data Manager (RDM) encapsulates the operational capabilities of the subsystem.  It exposes two interfaces.  Its main interface is used for the retrieval of reference data by other counter subsystems.  Its control interface may be accessed by Business Logic Objects to control the staging of reference data into the counter.&#xD;&#xA;Because reference data upgrades may result in inconsistent data or behaviour in the counter, BLOs may also cache subsets of the reference data. This is used by areas which need to maintain a value in reference data for some time. For example, the bureau subsystem must maintain a spot rate value between quote and transaction.&#xD;&#xA;The reference data files delivered contain both current and future dated reference data. The Reference Data Subsystem pre-processes the reference data files to obtain the current set of reference data for use by the counter applications.&#xD;&#xA;The application will continue to use an existing reference data set until new reference data is made available by the RDM and the application is in a state to accept it."/>
