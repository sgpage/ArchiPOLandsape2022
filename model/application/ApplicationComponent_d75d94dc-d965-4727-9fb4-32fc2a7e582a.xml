    documentation="The Interaction Subsystem encapsulates capabilities relating to interactions between the counter and the user.&#xD;&#xA;Interactions of particular types are managed by User Interaction Agents.  Each User Interaction Agent manages a single user interaction.&#xD;&#xA;User interactions are short, potentially reusable interactions with the user.&#xD;&#xA;A single User Interaction Agent Manager encapsulates the capability to create User Interaction Agents.&#xD;&#xA;A User Interaction Agent always has an owning capability, which is the capability that requested the creation of the User Interaction Agent.  This owning capability may be another User Interaction Agent.  The owning capability is responsible for causing the User Interaction Agent to destruct.&#xD;&#xA;User Interaction Agents can interact with each other.  A User Interaction Agent obtains references to other User Interaction Agents by creating new User Interaction Agents, receiving references from its owner or obtaining references from a User Interaction Agent to which it already has a reference.&#xD;&#xA;For further information, refer to the HNG-X Counter Applications: Interaction Subsystem High Level Design (DES/APP/HLD/0040)."/>
