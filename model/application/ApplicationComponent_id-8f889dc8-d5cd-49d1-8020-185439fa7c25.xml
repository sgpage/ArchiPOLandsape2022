The basic types of audit data that is&#xD;&#xA;collected are:&#xD;&#xA;• Counter application messages received by the Branch Access Layer. This will include&#xD;&#xA;counter transactions and events&#xD;&#xA;• Data transferred across HNG-X system boundaries. E.g. Bulk file transfers to and from Post&#xD;&#xA;Office and their clients&#xD;&#xA;• Host database systems audit and archive data.
