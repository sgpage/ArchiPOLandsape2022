Members of the public can access the form on the Post Office corporate web site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That web page is to be hosted in the Transitional Data Centre and integrated into an appropriate page in the Corporate web site.&#xD;&#xA;Internally that web form’s content will be passed to the MS Dynamics CRM based Case Management and Workflow Management system customised for the FOI purposes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Developed on MS Dynamics CRM/xRM.&#xA;&#xA;The eCase platform and the FOIA Teams site are not used as repositories but instead as case management tools.  More specifically, the eCase platform is used as a Case Management tool, not as a data repository, for tracking and managing DSARs and FOIA requests. The Teams site is used in conjunction with the eCase platform and the Teams site also holds data prior to the eCase platform being introduced in 2018 (i.e. 2012 - 2018). Both of these require approved access so shouldn’t be accessible to anyone outside Information Rights.&#xA;&#xA;Ecase - https://postoffice.ecase.co.uk/ecdirect/fox/ecase/&#xA; &#xA;Share Point – this is the main repository for the various case files covering FOI &amp; DPA -  https://poluk.sharepoint.com/sites/DataProtection/Tech/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?viewpath=%2Fsites%2FDataProtection%2FTech%2FShared%20Documents%2FForms%2FAllItems%2Easpx&#xA; "/>
