    documentation="[Think this is now dead]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;UKPA is used to validate passport application payments.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The primary aim of the UKPA system is to allow the reconciliation of passport applications processed over the counter by Post Office Ltd and invoices sent in by the United Kingdom Passport Authority for payments. All passport application forms are bar-coded with a unique number supplied by UKPA to all relevant outlets. A copy of the bar-code label on each application form is also stuck on to a daily application form (P5035).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Post Office receives the applications from customers and send it to Horizon Team and the Passport Office.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Horizon team validates the application and send it to the EDG team. Then the EDG team sends the data to the UKPA System in .CIF format. The data will come from EDG team on daily basis, and every day the data is imported by the UKPA system.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Passport Office sends the application details in Excel format to the UKPA System on weekly basis.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Then the UKPA System compares the two inputs that come from Passport Office Team and EDG Team, and generates the reports.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;UKPA system produces the following reports:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;• Mismatch Reports&#xD;&#xA;• Horizon Import Summary Report&#xD;&#xA;• Horizon Import Audit Report&#xD;&#xA;• Invoice Breakdown Report&#xD;&#xA;• IPS Barcodes Report"/>
