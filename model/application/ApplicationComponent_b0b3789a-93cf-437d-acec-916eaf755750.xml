    documentation="The Peripheral Subsystem provides the capability to interact with the counter peripherals programmatically.&#xD;&#xA;The subsystem also ensures that any configuration policies regarding the management of the peripherals are enforced.&#xD;&#xA;The subsystem is decomposed into the following capabilities:&#xD;&#xA;•&#x9;One Peripheral Manager&#xD;&#xA;•&#x9;For each peripheral, a Peripheral Operation Unit. This mediates all interactions between the peripheral and its consumers.&#xD;&#xA;Peripheral Operational Unit capabilities may be configured using reference data.&#xD;&#xA;For further information, refer to the HNG-X Counter Applications: Peripheral Subsystem High Level Design (DES/APP/HLD/0038)."/>
